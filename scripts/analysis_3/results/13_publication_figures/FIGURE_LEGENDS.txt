TES vs TEAD1 Comparative Multi-Omics Study
================================================================================

FIGURE 1: Study Overview
-------------------------
(A) Bar chart showing the number of binding sites in each of six binding
    categories: TES-unique, TEAD1-unique, and four shared categories
    (equivalent, TES-dominant, TEAD1-dominant, all shared).
(B) Pie chart showing the proportional distribution of binding categories.

FIGURE 2: Binding Characterization
-----------------------------------
(A) Violin plots showing TES signal intensity (CPM, log10 scale) across
    binding categories. Box plots overlay shows median and quartiles.
(B) Violin plots showing TEAD1 signal intensity across binding categories.
(C) Violin plots showing signal ratio (log2 TES/TEAD1) by binding category.
    Dashed red line indicates equal binding (ratio = 0).

FIGURE 3: Expression Integration
---------------------------------
(A) Violin plots showing log2 fold change (TES vs GFP) stratified by binding
    category. Dashed red line indicates no change (log2FC = 0).
(B) Volcano plot showing differential expression with points colored by
    binding category. Dashed lines indicate significance thresholds
    (padj < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1).
(C) Bar chart showing counts of upregulated and downregulated DEGs by
    binding category.

FIGURE 4: Methylation Integration
----------------------------------
(A) Pie chart showing the distribution of genes across regulatory
    mechanisms identified by three-way integration (binding + methylation
    + expression).
(B) Violin plots showing gene expression changes stratified by methylation
    status (hypermethylated, hypomethylated, no change).
(C) Bar chart showing mean expression change for each regulatory mechanism.
    Numbers indicate gene counts per mechanism.

FIGURE 5: Regulatory Networks
------------------------------
(A) Volcano plot showing master regulator enrichment. X-axis shows TF
    expression change, Y-axis shows target gene enrichment significance.
    Points are colored by significance (padj < 0.05). Top TFs are labeled.
(B) Bar chart showing the top 20 master regulators ranked by enrichment
    p-value. Bars are colored by TF expression change (log2FC).
(C) Scatter plot showing correlation between TF expression change and
    target gene enrichment. Point size indicates number of target genes
    in DEG list.

FIGURE 6: Target Prioritization
--------------------------------
(A) Histogram showing distribution of priority scores across all genes.
    Colors indicate priority tiers (High, Medium, Low, Very Low). Dashed
    lines show tier thresholds (30, 50, 70).
(B) Heatmap showing component scores for top 30 prioritized genes. Columns
    represent score components (binding, expression, significance,
    methylation, biological relevance, novelty).
(C) Correlation matrix showing pairwise correlations between score
    components. Values range from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).

FIGURE 7: Comprehensive Summary
--------------------------------
(A) Bar chart summarizing key study statistics including total binding
    sites, unique/shared sites, genes analyzed, DEGs, and direct targets.
(B) Workflow diagram illustrating the five analysis phases: binding
    classification, expression integration, methylation integration,
    network analysis, and target prioritization.
