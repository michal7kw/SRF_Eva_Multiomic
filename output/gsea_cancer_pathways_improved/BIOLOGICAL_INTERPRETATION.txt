KEY FINDINGS:
-------------

TES TRANSCRIPTIONAL EFFECTS:
  Apoptosis: 5 upregulated, 63 downregulated
  â†’ Interpretation: TES predominantly INHIBITS apoptosis (pro-survival)


NOTE: This analysis provides directional context for pathway regulation.
Upregulated apoptosis + Downregulated proliferation = Anti-cancer effect
Upregulated migration = Pro-metastatic effect
